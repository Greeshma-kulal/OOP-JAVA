# ðŸ“š Library Management System 

This is a **project** I built in Java to practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
Itâ€™s a simple **Library Management System** where you can:  
- Add books  
- Borrow and return them  
- Handle special **reference books** 
- Check availability of any book  

I also wrote **JUnit test cases** so that I donâ€™t have to manually test everything every time.  

---

##  What I used
- **Base class** â†’ `Book`  
- **Inherited class** â†’ `ReferenceBook`  
- **Interface** â†’ `Issueable`  
- **Helper class** â†’ `Library` (stores all the books using arrays)  
- **Main class** â†’ runs the program through a simple menu  
- **JUnit Test class** â†’ to check if all the above work correctly  

---
## ðŸ›  Tools & Requirements
- Java 8 or above  
- JUnit 4 (for test cases)  
- Any IDE (I used Eclipse)  

---

## âœ… What I learned
- How **classes, inheritance, and interfaces** fit together in a project.  
- How to test functionality with **JUnit** instead of only relying on print statements.  
- How to organize code into packages and keep it clean.  

---

## ðŸŒ± Future Scope
- Add student/admin roles  
- Track due dates & fines  
- Use collections like `ArrayList` instead of arrays  
- Maybe create a GUI version later

ðŸ‘‰ This project is simple but it gave me hands-on practice with Java OOP and testing.
