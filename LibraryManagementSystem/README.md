# ðŸ“š Library Management System (Java)

This is a **mini project** I built in Java to practice Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
Itâ€™s a simple **Library Management System** where you can:  
- Add books  
- Borrow and return them  
- Handle special **reference books** (which canâ€™t be borrowed)  
- Check availability of any book  

I also wrote **JUnit test cases** so that I donâ€™t have to manually test everything every time.

##  What I used
- **Base class** â†’ `Book`  
- **Inherited class** â†’ `ReferenceBook`  
- **Interface** â†’ `Issueable`  
- **Helper class** â†’ `Library` (stores all the books using arrays)  
- **Main class** â†’ runs the program through a simple menu  
- **JUnit Test class** â†’ to check if all the above work correctly
